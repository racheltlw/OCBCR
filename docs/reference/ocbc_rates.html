1. For Fixed Deposits the function returns a list containing a dataframe of the fixed deposit interest rates according to the duration in months as well as a graph of this information. <br />
2. For Foreign Exchange the function returns a dataframe containing the bank buying rate and bank selling rate, information on the local currency and foreign currency as well as the rate list unit. <br />
3. For Unit Trust the function returns an empty dataframe as this information is not yet available through the API.</p>
